In these posts we're hoping to give brief updates as to what we're doing and what progress we're making.

The Turntabl group has two goals: firstly, to be a software agency delivering high quality results in the Western market. And secondly, to be a premium employer to young developers in Ghana.

By achieving these goals, we also hope to build a strong culture of Giving Back, through which we'll make concrete positive changes in the lives of our employees, their families, and the wider community.

We'll start operations in mid-October, and to that end we've been working hard behind the scenes to make it all happen. Here's what we've done so far:

* We've set up a company in the UK, Turntabl Ltd, which will attract clients and collect invoices. 
* Turntabl Ghana will hire developers and prepare them for professional work.
* Ghana has compulsory National Service for new graduates, so we're going to set ourselves up as a National Service employer.
* We're looking for office space in Accra! Our office needs to be accessible to all our employees, and it needs to have great internet.
* Meanwhile, we're preparing training material for a 10-week training program to be delivered before Christmas
* And finally, we're hiring! We aim to have 20 employees in Ghana by October and currently we have 13 fully signed up.

It's very exciting, and there's a lot more to do, but we're all very proud with our progress.
